    <h1 class="text-light">Why omnix exists</h1>
    <p class="text-light">omnix’s mission is to share and grow the world’s knowledge. Not all knowledge can be written down, but much of that which can be, still isn't. It remains in people’s heads or only accessible if you know the right people. We want to connect the people who have knowledge to the people who need it, to bring together people with different perspectives so they can understand each other better, and to empower everyone to share their knowledge for the benefit of the rest of the world.</p>

    <h2 class="text-light">Gather around a question</h2>
    <p class="text-light">The heart of omnix is questions — questions that affect the world, questions that explain recent world events, questions that guide important life decisions, and questions that provide insights into why other people think differently. omnix is a place where you can ask questions that matter to you and get answers from people who have been there and done that. omnix is where scientists, artists, entrepreneurs, mechanics, and homemakers take refuge from misinformation and incendiary arguments to share what they know.</p>

  <h2 class="text-light">Share a Question</h2>
  <p class="text-light">Ever since the first humans gathered around a fire and turned their gaze to the stars, humanity has shared knowledge through stories. Spaces are digital campfires for collective meaning making which expand knowledge sharing from interrogative to narrative. In Spaces, creators build audiences of millions for their unique insights or audiences of thousands for niche knowledge that can't be found anywhere else.</p>
